# LAZY VIM CONFIG

## About

This config is based on lazyvim, for web development and python in perticular.  
Config consistes of all the goodies from lazyvim with with tokyonight as the defalut theme.  
It also consistes of noice.nvim, with telescope and indent blank line.

I was able to configure it to work with anaconda and python env, the only cache being user
must activate the env first and then enter the project to work on it or uses the default python
provider which is activate.

I was not able to configure venv-selector, don't know the reson why is does not work. Will figure
out something to make it work.

Took me log enough to configure this as I am new to this nvim world and was learning lua in the process,
it is a good thing that one can make their own ide like vscode and configure it to their own needs and desire.

I was able to do this with the right guidence from [josean github](https://github.com/josean-dev/dev-environment-files) go check out his nvim
config and also his [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@joseanmartinez) he has all the videos for all
types of configuration like fomatting, linting, autocomplete, lsp, and ui stuff you will like it and also will be
able to learn some new this from his videos.
